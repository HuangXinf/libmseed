 <div class="CBody"><div class="CHeading">An Introduction to libmseed</div><p>The miniSEED library provides a framework for manipulation of SEED data records including the unpacking and packing of data records.&nbsp; Functionality is also included for managing waveform data as continuous traces.&nbsp; All structures of SEED 2.4 data records are supported with the following exceptions: Blockette 2000 opaque data which has an unknown data structure by definition and Blockette 405 which depends on full SEED (SEED including full ASCII headers) for a full data description.</p><p>The primary purpose of the library is to hide the details of miniSEED in order to allow rapid development of miniSEED reading/writing software.&nbsp; The framework allows everything from manipulation of miniSEED on a record-by-record basis to reading of miniSEED into continuous trace segments to packing of large continuous traces using a record template.</p><p>Certain common tasks have, through library design, been streamlined, for example: reading miniSEED records from a file, adding data from unpacked records to a group of traces or packing a group of continuous traces into miniSEED records.</p><p>The following data encoding formats are supported for both unpacking and packing: ASCII, INT16, INT32, FLOAT32, FLOAT64, STEIM1 and STEIM2.&nbsp; The INT and FLOAT encodings each have two versions for quantities with a different number of bits of representation.&nbsp; The STEIM decompression produces 32-bit integers; likewise the compression routines require 32-bit integers as input.&nbsp; The following data encoding formats are supported for unpacking only: GEOSCOPE (24-bit, 16/3 and 16/4 gain ranged), CDSN, SRO and DWWSSN.</p></div>
